SECTION: Refund Entitlement — Cancellation
If an airline cancels a flight, a consumer is entitled to a refund of the ticket price to the original form of payment if the consumer chooses not to travel or accept alternative compensation (vouchers, credits, etc.).

SECTION: Refund Entitlement — Significant Delay or Change
A consumer is entitled to a refund if the airline significantly delays a flight or significantly changes a flight and the consumer chooses not to travel or accept travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation.

SECTION: Definition of Significant Change or Delay
Significant change or delay includes:
- Scheduled departure 3+ hours earlier (domestic) or 6+ hours earlier (international).
- Scheduled arrival 3+ hours later (domestic) or 6+ hours later (international).
- Change in origin or destination airports.
- Additional connection points added beyond the original itinerary.
- Involuntary downgrade to a lower class of service.
- Change in connecting airports for passengers with a disability.
- Change in aircraft removing accessibility features required by a passenger with a disability.

SECTION: Downgrade Refund Rules
A consumer involuntarily downgraded to a lower class of service is entitled to a refund if they choose not to travel or accept compensation. If the downgraded consumer continues travel, the airline must refund the difference between the original and downgraded fare.

SECTION: Fully Refundable Tickets
Consumers who purchased fully refundable tickets are entitled to a refund when they do not use the ticket, regardless of delay or cancellation.

SECTION: Notification Requirement
Airlines are required to notify passengers of cancellations, significant delays, and the right to receive a refund. Notification must be provided via the passenger’s chosen contact method (email, text, mobile app push).

SECTION: Non-Refundable Situations
A consumer is not entitled to a refund when:
- The consumer chooses to travel on a significantly delayed or changed flight.
- The consumer purchased a non-refundable ticket and the flight operates as scheduled.
- The consumer traveled but experienced unsatisfactory service (this does not entitle a refund).

SECTION: Ancillary Services — Refund of Fees
Consumers are entitled to refunds of fees for ancillary services (e.g., baggage, seat selection, Wi-Fi) if the service was unavailable through no fault of the consumer (e.g., broken Wi-Fi, airline cancellation).

SECTION: Baggage Fee Refund — Lost or Significantly Delayed
Consumers who paid baggage fees are entitled to a refund if the checked baggage is declared lost or is significantly delayed (see baggage policy file for definitions). Airlines are not required to define “lost” uniformly; many declare a bag lost after 5–14 days, but this varies.

SECTION: Automatic Refund After Offer of Alternatives
If an airline offers alternative transportation (rebooking) after cancellation or significant change, and the consumer:
- rejects the offer,
- does not respond,
- or does not travel on the alternative,
then the refund must be processed automatically without requiring a separate consumer request.

SECTION: Refund Timing Requirements
Refunds must be issued within:
- 7 business days if paid by credit card.
- 20 calendar days if paid by cash or check.

SECTION: 24-Hour Purchase/Reservation Right
If a ticket is purchased or reserved at least 7 days before scheduled departure, airlines must:
- Allow cancellation for a full refund within 24 hours, or
- Allow a hold at quoted price without payment and permit cancellation within 24 hours without penalty.
This rule does not apply to tickets purchased through third-party agents unless those agents elect similar procedures.

SECTION: Merchant of Record Responsibility
Ticket agents (travel agents or online travel agencies) that are the merchant of record on the financial statement are responsible for issuing refunds when required by DOT rules. If a third party was the merchant of record, refunds for DOT-mandated events must still be provided according to the rule, but consumers must know whom to contact.
